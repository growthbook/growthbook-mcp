# Contributing to GrowthBook MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Follow these steps to work locally and test your changes:

## Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/growthbook-mcp.git
   cd growthbook-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**

   Use TypeScript to generate the build:

   ```sh
   npx tsc
   ```

   This will output the compiled JavaScript files to the `dist/` directory (or as configured in `tsconfig.json`).

4. **Add the server to your AI tool**

When configuring your MCP client (e.g., Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop), use the absolute path to your local build. Example JSON config:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "growthbook": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/growthbook-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "GB_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
           "GB_USER": "your-name",
           "GB_API_URL": "your-api-url",
           "GB_APP_ORIGIN": "your-app-origin"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/growthbook-mcp/dist/index.js` with the actual path on your machine. If you're testing with a local version of GrowthBook, be sure to update environment variables to point to your local install.

GrowthBook MCP is now ready to use ðŸ¤–

## Bonus: Use the MCP Inspector ðŸš€

For a better development and debugging experience, try the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to test tools and more.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e GB_API_KEY=<value> -e GB_USER=<name> -e GB_API_URL=http://localhost:3100 -e GB_APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 node build/index.js
